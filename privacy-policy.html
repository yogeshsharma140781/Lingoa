        <h3>Audio Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Voice Recordings:</strong> We collect audio recordings of your voice when you use the app to practice speaking. This audio is used for speech recognition and transcription.</li>
            <li><strong>Microphone Access:</strong> The app requires microphone permission to record your voice during conversation practice sessions.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Speech Recognition Data</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Transcribed Text:</strong> Your voice recordings are transcribed into text using speech recognition technology (OpenAI Whisper).</li>
            <li><strong>Conversation Content:</strong> The transcribed text of your conversations is processed to generate AI responses and provide language learning feedback.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Usage Data</h3>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Speech-to-Text:</strong> Your audio recordings are processed using OpenAI Whisper for accurate transcription.</li>
            <li><strong>Text-to-Speech:</strong> AI-generated responses are converted to speech using text-to-speech technology (OpenAI TTS or ElevenLabs) to provide audio feedback.</li>
            <li><strong>App Functionality:</strong> Your preferences and settings are used to personalize your experience and maintain your practice streak.</li>
            <li><strong>Improvement:</strong> We may use aggregated, anonymized data to improve our services and AI conversation quality.</li>
