# Privacy Policy Hosting Options

Since GitHub Pages requires a public repository, here are your options:

## Option 1: Make Repository Public (Easiest)

The privacy policy file itself is fine to be public - it's meant to be publicly accessible anyway.

### Steps:
1. Go to: https://github.com/yogeshsharma140781/Lingoa/settings
2. Scroll down to **"Danger Zone"**
3. Click **"Change visibility"**
4. Select **"Make public"**
5. Type the repository name to confirm
6. Then enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch `main`)

**Privacy Policy URL will be:**
```
https://yogeshsharma140781.github.io/Lingoa/privacy-policy.html
```

## Option 2: Host on Your Render Backend (No Public Repo Needed)

Since your backend is already on Render, you can serve the privacy policy from there.

### Steps:
1. The privacy policy is already in your repo
2. Update your backend to serve static files
3. Access at: `https://lingoa.onrender.com/privacy-policy.html`

I can help you set this up if you prefer this option.

## Option 3: Use a Free Static Hosting Service

- **Netlify**: Free, can deploy from GitHub
- **Vercel**: Free, can deploy from GitHub
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Free, can deploy from GitHub

## Option 4: Use GitHub Gist (Quick Temporary Solution)

1. Create a Gist with the HTML content
2. Use the Gist URL (but this isn't ideal for App Store)

## ✅ Recommended: Option 1 (Make Repo Public)

The privacy policy is meant to be public anyway, so making the repo public is the simplest solution. Your source code will be visible, but that's common for open-source projects.

Would you like me to:
1. Help you make the repo public and set up GitHub Pages?
2. Set up hosting on your Render backend instead?
